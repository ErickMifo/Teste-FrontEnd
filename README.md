# Desafio guiado erick-mifo-frontend  

A responsive front-end of a news website made with ReactJS and a couple of dependencies such as:
1. Axios to fetch data;
2. Framer-motion and react-intersection-observer to make some animations;
3. Material UI just for some icons;
4. React-router-dom for routes;
5. query-string for the login/welcome pages.
